[Verse 1]
The other night dear, as I lay sleeping
I dreamed I held you in my arms
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken
So I bowed my head and I cried

[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I've always loved you and made you happy
And nothing else could come between
But now you've left me to love another
You have shattered all of my dreams


[Chorus]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
You make me happy when skies are gray
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you
Please don't take my sunshine away
You might also like


[Spoken Outro]
(I always hated that third verse)
*Laughter*
It was a nice short version
Do you wanna- uh, pick it up?
I't's alright (It's good)
(We got a short version)
It might have that other verse on it in another take
Well, I'll tell you what... Let's... uhm...
Well, if I feel like my song's a song... *Laughter*
It don't care... (There you go!)
I don't care if it's short
And I feel like my song's a song
A pleasure! Two minutes... I've recorded songs two minutes
(They were huge hits!)
Have you got, uh, time on that?
